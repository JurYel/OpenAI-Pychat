# OpenAI-Pychat

A simple chat client interfacing with OpenAI's Completion API.

### TODO:
1. Handle detection of `OPENAI_API_KEY` availability
2. `max_tokens` can be set as a parameter outside
3. empty input from user. Suggested to use try-except
4. `engine` be set as a parameter with a default of 'text-davinci-03'
5. choices should be checked if we actually have values

### Additional Features:
1. Put code in while loop so you won't have to rerun program
